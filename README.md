# CamBot 6D for Star Citizen

**Six degrees of freedom spline interpolation with opentrack UDP-over-network output.**

With CamBot 6D, can remotely control the in-game camera position and orientation in all six degrees of freedom. Simply set individual waypoints and the software will move the in-game camera along a smooth path at a predefined speed.

You can also use CamBot 6D to split the advanced camera controls of Star Citizen between two real-time operators. One operator will control the camera angle around its pivot directly at the gaming PC, while the other controls the relative camera position and orientation remotely from a second computer.

# Features

Currently broken

# Limitations

- **Camera offset limited to Â±5 meters in X,Y,Z directions**  
  This is a limitation of 3rd person camera head tracking controls in Star Citizen and cannot be circumvented.

# Dokumentation

A full walkthough of how to use CamBot 6D is on my website:

# Dependencies

### Requirements:

- **opentrack**: https://github.com/opentrack/opentrack/releases  
  if you use TrackIR head tracking, terminate the TrackIR v5 Windows app before using CamBot 6D
- **Star Citizen**: https://robertsspaceindustries.com/enlist?referral=STAR-F3GJ-MFBD

### Optional:

- **3Dconnexion SpaceMouse** (Enterprise, Pro, or Compact) for full analog 6 axis control
- **Microsoft Xbox Controller** (Series X, Series S, or One) for analog 5 axis control (digital control for roll)  
  if you use CamBot 6D on your gaming PC, 
- **Elgato Stream Deck** with [MQTT plugin](https://apps.elgato.com/plugins/com.bi0s.mqtt)  
  requires an MQTT message broker such as [Eclipse Mosquitto](https://mosquitto.org/) to communicate

# Changelog

Initial pre-release.

# Builds

We are in early testing. Alpha builds for Windows are available here:  

https://github.com/gulbrillo/CamBot-6D/releases

# Run

Requires Python 3.10 or higher.

> python3.10.exe .\CamBot6D.py

# Compile

Spec file is provided. This will create a one file executable `CamBot6D.exe` in `./dist`. 
> python3.10.exe -m PyInstaller CamBot6D.spec

The spec file can be created with
> python3.10.exe -m PyInstaller --noconsole --onefile --windowed --icon=icon.ico --add-data "./images;images" CamBot6D.py

But you need to replace the `datas` line in `CamBot6D.spec` with this:
> datas=[('./images', 'images'),('./icons', 'icons'),('./fonts', 'fonts')],
